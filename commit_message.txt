[Cursor] Fix invalid regex pattern in Vercel headers configuration

- Remove complex regex pattern "/(.*\\.(ico|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|webp|svg|css|js))" from headers
- Vercel doesn't support complex regex in headers source patterns
- Keep essential cache headers for _next/static and images directories
- Clean up vercel.json formatting for better readability
- Update .cursorrules with learned lesson about Vercel header patterns

Configuration now passes Vercel validation and is deployment-ready.
